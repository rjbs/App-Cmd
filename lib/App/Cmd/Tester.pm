# ABSTRACT: for capturing the result of running an app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More tests => 4;
  use App::Cmd::Tester;

  use YourApp;

  my $result = test_app(YourApp => [ qw(command --opt value) ]);

  like($result->stdout, qr/expected output/, 'printed what we expected');

  is($result->stderr, '', 'nothing sent to sderr');

  is($result->error, undef, 'threw no exceptions');

  my $result = test_app(YourApp => [ qw(command --opt value --quiet) ]);

  is($result->output, '', 'absolutely no output with --quiet');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the reasons that user-executed programs are so often poorly tested is
that they are hard to test.  App::Cmd::Tester is one of the tools App-Cmd
provides to help make it easy to test App::Cmd-based programs.

It provides one routine: test_app.

=method test_app

B<Note>: while C<test_app> is a method, it is by default exported as a
subroutine into the namespace that uses App::Cmd::Tester.  In other words: you
probably don't need to think about this as a method unless you want to subclass
App::Cmd::Tester.

  my $result = test_app($app_class => \@argv_contents);

This will locally set C<@ARGV> to simulate command line arguments, and will
then call the C<run> method on the given application class (or application).
Output to the standard output and standard error filehandles  will be captured.

C<$result> is an App::Cmd::Tester::Result object, which has methods to access
the following data:

  stdout - the output sent to stdout
  stderr - the output sent to stderr
  output - the combined output of stdout and stderr
  error  - the exception thrown by running the application, or undef
  run_rv - the return value of the run method (generally irrelevant)
  exit_code - the numeric exit code that would've been issued (0 is 'okay')
