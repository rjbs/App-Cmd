# ABSTRACT: list the application's commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command plugin implements a "commands" command.  This command will list
all of an App::Cmd's commands and their abstracts.

=method execute

This is the command's primary method and raison d'etre.  It prints the
application's usage text (if any) followed by a sorted listing of the
application's commands and their abstracts.

The commands are printed in sorted groups (created by C<sort_commands>); each
group is set off by blank lines.

sub execute {
  my ($self, $opt, $args) = @_;

  my $target = $opt->stderr ? *STDERR : *STDOUT;

  local $@;
  eval { print { $target } $self->app->_usage_text . "\n" };

  print { $target } "Available commands:\n\n";

  my @primary_commands =
    grep { $_ ne '--version' }
    map { ($_->command_names)[0] }
    $self->app->command_plugins;

  my @cmd_groups = $self->sort_commands(@primary_commands);

  my $fmt_width = 0;
  for (@primary_commands) { $fmt_width = length if length > $fmt_width }
  $fmt_width += 2; # pretty

  foreach my $cmd_set (@cmd_groups) {
    for my $command (@$cmd_set) {
      my $abstract = $self->app->plugin_for($command)->abstract;
      printf { $target } "%${fmt_width}s: %s\n", $command, $abstract;
    }
    print { $target } "\n";
  }
}

=method C<sort_commands>

  my @sorted = $cmd->sort_commands(@unsorted);

This method orders the list of commands into sets which it returns as a list of
arrayrefs.

By default, the first group is for the "help" and "commands" commands, and all
other commands are in the second group.

=cut

sub sort_commands {
  my ($self, @commands) = @_;

  my $float = qr/^(?:help|commands)$/;

  my @head = sort grep { $_ =~ $float } @commands;
  my @tail = sort grep { $_ !~ $float } @commands;

  return (\@head, \@tail);
}

sub opt_spec {
  return (
    [ 'stderr' => 'hidden' ],
  );
