          require the correct version of Getopt::Long::Descriptive (thanks,
          Glen Hinkle)

0.310     2010-12-11
          classes are now loaded with Class::Load, which should avoid bugs
          where classes are not succesfully loaded by program execution
          continues anyway (thanks to Kent Fredric)

          more checking is now done to ensure that plugins are members of the
          correct base class (thanks, Kent Fredric)

0.309     2010-11-12

          skip a failing test on perl 5.8.x

0.308     2010-11-08

          When App::Cmd::Setup tries to load MyApp::Command, and it exists but
          will not compile, the exception will now propagate.  Previously, it
          failed silently and App::Cmd::Command was used instead.  (bug found
          and fixed and tested for by Kent Fredric; thanks!)

0.307     2010-03-09
          bump up required version of Getopt::Long::Descriptive

0.306     2010-03-08
          return the App::Cmd object (when non-Simple) in the Tester result
          allow App::Cmd::Tester subclasses to chose another Result class

0.305     2010-03-07
          App::Cmd::Tester now reports (probable?) exit code of tested apps
          some improvements to the tutorial and other docs
          added some documentation for App::Cmd::Setup
          now searches for plugins under App::Cmd::Plugin::; use = to prevent

0.304     2009-12-07
          remove use of deprecated "-run" from synopsis (thanks, George
          Hartzell)

0.303     2009-11-27
          revert behavior of App::Cmd 0.302 -- GLD no longer gives undef opts

0.302     2009-11-27
          expect undef values for acceptable-but-ungiven options in $opt

0.301     2009-09-02
          fix App::Cmd::Simple docs to show ->execute (noticed by MIYAGAWA)

0.300     2009-08-28
          DEPRECATED -run OPTION TO APP CLASS IMPORT
          "use MyApp -run;" is deprecated; it will be removed after no less
          than a year

          this led to problems where normal exit-on-error messages confused
          users by complaining about failing to compile; magic to stop this is
          not worth the tiny savings

          COMMANDS SHOULD NOW HAVE ->execute RATHER THAN ->run
          this will not break you code... except:

          WILL BREAK YOUR CODE: App::Cmd::Simple programs must use ->execute
          rather than ->run

0.207     2009-08-27

          (thanks, Jerome Quelin)

          thanks to GAISSMAI and Jerome Quelin for reporting

0.204     2009-06-27
          document the need for calling ->import on Simple apps
          add tests for Simple-based apps
