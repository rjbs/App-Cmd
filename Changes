Revision history for App-Cmd

0.306     2010-03-08
          return the App::Cmd object (when non-Simple) in the Tester result
          allow App::Cmd::Tester subclasses to chose another Result class

0.305     2010-03-07
          App::Cmd::Tester now reports (probable?) exit code of tested apps
          some improvements to the tutorial and other docs
          added some documentation for App::Cmd::Setup
          now searches for plugins under App::Cmd::Plugin::; use = to prevent

0.304     2009-12-07
          remove use of deprecated "-run" from synopsis (thanks, George
          Hartzell)

0.303     2009-11-27
          revert behavior of App::Cmd 0.302 -- GLD no longer gives undef opts

0.302     2009-11-27
          expect undef values for acceptable-but-ungiven options in $opt

0.301     2009-09-02
          fix App::Cmd::Simple docs to show ->execute (noticed by MIYAGAWA)

0.300     2009-08-28
          DEPRECATED -run OPTION TO APP CLASS IMPORT
          "use MyApp -run;" is deprecated; it will be removed after no less
          than a year

          this led to problems where normal exit-on-error messages confused
          users by complaining about failing to compile; magic to stop this is
          not worth the tiny savings

          COMMANDS SHOULD NOW HAVE ->execute RATHER THAN ->run
          this will not break you code... except:

          WILL BREAK YOUR CODE: App::Cmd::Simple programs must use ->execute
          rather than ->run

0.207     2009-08-27
          add option to allow any unambiguous command abbreviation
          (thanks, Jerome Quelin)

          new super-concise ::Setup interface provided by Sub::Exporter
